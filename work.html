	<p class="C">There are four different langange in the html</p>
	<h3 class="B"><u>Html</u></h3>
	<p class="B">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is one of the most widely used coding languages in web development. As a markup language, it refers to the ways in which web pages are linked together and is primarily used to inform a web browser of how to display a web page’s elements via tags. For instance, thetag represents a digital document’s displayed header, potentially containing other tags related to information like a title or relevant link.</p>
	<h3 class="B"><u>css</u></h3>
	<p class="B">Along with JavaScript and HTML, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is consistently one of the most-used coding languages in front end development, making it an asset to the full stack role. CSS is primarily used to create an aesthetically pleasing design — specifically the color- and style-based code added to HTML structural elements. For example, a background-color: lightblue element would set the site’s user-facing background to light blue.</p>
	<h3 class="B"><u>java</u></h3>
	<p class="B">Java tends to rank highly among many top programming language rankings and surveys. This general-purpose language is primarily used in back end web development, and can be applied to a wide variety of different software types. It is imperative for full stack developers to learn languages like Java, as they can be applied to countless scenarios in application construction, maintenance, and conceptualization.</p>
	<h3 class="B"><u>Bootcamp</u></h3>
	<p class="B">Coding bootcamps are among the most effective methods for learning front and back end development skills. These courses offer the chance to learn web development through practical instruction, making use of flexible, intensive curricula to prepare learners for a career in full stack development. No two bootcamps are the same, which is indicative of both their personalization and level of detail in a given concentration.</p>
